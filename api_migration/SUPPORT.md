## Filing Issues and Seeking Assistance  

We use GitHub Issues as our primary platform for tracking bugs and discussing new features. To avoid redundancy, please look through existing issues before submitting a new one. If you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to open a new issue.

## Support Policy  

Though this project is an open-source initiative, it does not receive formal support from Microsoft's APIM product team. However, Microsoft Cloud Solution Architects are actively involved in maintaining and overseeing the project. They are in regular communication with the APIM product team, giving them early insights into the product's roadmap.

## Advance Notice on Future Developments
