Quick question — for our external-facing TLS certificates (standard HTTPS, not client-auth or mTLS), can we use CLM to request and manage Sectigo certificates, or are we still expected to obtain them directly from Sectigo?

Just trying to confirm whether CLM fully supports external Sectigo certs or if it’s limited to internal PKIRA/MSPKI use.
